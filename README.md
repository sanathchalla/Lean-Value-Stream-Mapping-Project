Lean Value Stream Mapping Project

Description:

This repository documents a Lean Value Stream Mapping project conducted to optimize manufacturing processes at FEI (Fictitious Engineering, Inc.). The project, completed as part of the course PROD 1024 - Advanced Principles in Lean Manufacturing, includes the design and analysis of current and future state process mapping.

Key Features:

- Design and analysis of current state process mapping to identify inefficiencies and bottlenecks.
- Development of future state process mapping objectives aimed at streamlining operations and reducing waste.
- Detailed implementation plan outlining steps to transition from current to future state processes.
- Application of Lean methodologies such as TAKT time analysis, continuous flow implementation, and supermarket pull systems.
- References to Lean literature, including "Learning to See" by Rother and Shook.

Outcome:

Provides insights into Lean principles and their application in manufacturing environments.
Offers a practical example of process mapping and optimization in a real-world context.
Serves as a resource for students and professionals interested in Lean manufacturing and process improvement.
